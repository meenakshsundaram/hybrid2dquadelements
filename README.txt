This library provides the algorithms for performing a linear finite element 
analysis using a hybrid interpolation of both stress and strain. 

This is derived from the paper 
"C.S.Jog. A 27-node hybrid brick and a 21-node hybrid wedge element for 
structural analysis, 2007"

Run demogripper.m a demo program which evaluates the displacement of a 
compliant gripper
